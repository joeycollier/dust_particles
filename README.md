# Dust Particles

A Flutter project to display floating dust particles (dust specks). I was going for a subtle effect that could be overlaid on top of background artwork.  The code is commented and could easily be changed for a more prominent effect.

## Technology

This project is written in Flutter ~ Feb, 2023 using the latest stable releases
* For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,

This project uses the simple_animations package to produce animations (tweens).
* See https://pub.dev/packages/simple_animations for more info about this package

This project is my first project using ChatGPT to help code the animation.
* I used prompts to determine a way to animate the floating particles
* ChatGPT suggested using sinusoidal patterns for the particle animation
* You can learn more about ChatGPT at https://chat.openai.com/chat

I used JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate as the IDE for this project.  Android Studio is another viable option.
